# Slay the Spire Clone

## Objective
Create a simplified, terminal-based version of *Slay the Spire*, a strategic deck-building game with roguelike elements. The aim is to replicate the core mechanics of the game while allowing future expansions, such as a GUI.

## Features
- **Status Effects**: Implement both positive and negative status effects, such as poison, healing, weakening, and strengthening, each with their own duration and mechanics.
- **Combat System**: Engage in battles against single or multiple enemies simultaneously, with turn-based combat mechanics.
- **Deckbuilding**: Build a unique deck by acquiring cards throughout the game, allowing for diverse strategies and tactics.
- **Roguelike Mechanics**: Embrace procedural generation and permadeath, ensuring each run is unique and challenging.
- **Dynamic Turn-Based Strategy**: Make strategic decisions in each battle, leveraging status effects, block, and attack cards to defeat enemies.
- **Expandable Architecture**: The codebase is designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to add new types of enemies, cards, and status effects.
- **Future GUI Expansion**: Built with the potential to evolve into a GUI-based game, offering a more visually immersive experience.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Slay-the-Spire-Clone
2. Build the project: (requires having `make` installed)
   ```bash
   make
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   ./a
## Future Goals
- **Graphical Interface**: Transition from a terminal-based interface to a graphical one using libraries like SDL or SFML.
- **Character Customization**: Allow players to choose different characters, each with unique starting decks and abilities.
- **Advanced AI**: Improve enemy AI to provide a more challenging and adaptive combat experience.
